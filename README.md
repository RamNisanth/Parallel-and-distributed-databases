# Parallel-and-distributed-databases
Project of parallel and distributed databases subject.
I have chosen a dataset and ingested it into Amazon S3 Bucket, preprocessed the data and applied filtering, transformation, loading, aggregation, and analysis on the data. 
Performed exploratory data analysis and gained insights from the data. at the end, applied a machine learning algorithm and uncovered hidden patterns.
